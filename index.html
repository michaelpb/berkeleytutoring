    Hey!

    I bet you're the type that likes exploring source code. Well, your in luck!
    This site is written in my own declarative web component framework Modulo
    JS. I kept it simple so it's actually running in "dev" mode. This means you
    can even "build" it in your browser, if you want to! Really, try bringing
    up Dev Tools (Ctrl Shift J on some browsers) and look for the Modulo
    COMMANDS menu, then click "build" (possibly twice, if on Firefox).  The
    entire thing is pretty simple, only a few thousands lines of code total.

    Anyway, feel free to look at the rest of the source code to see how the
    "magic" happens ("look ma, no node_modules!")

    <h2>PRIVATE LESSONS</h2>
    <p>Are you looking for an extra boost in CS? Does Big O feel more like a Big
    Ol‚Äô pile of confusion? Is Linux is going in one ear, and out to /dev/null? Or,
    having conquered the basics, are you looking for the next real challenge in
    your tech career?</p>

    <p>I can help! I‚Äôve guided 100s of students before‚Äì let me help you!    My
    students range from coding newbies struggling with ‚Äúweed-out‚Äù classes, to
    industry veterans needing an emergency ‚Äúbrushing up‚Äù on algos before the big
    interview.</p>

    <h2>TUTORING PLANS</h2>
    <p><strong>Private Zoom-Based Half-Hour Lessons</strong> - We can get
    through <em>A LOT</em> of stuff in a half-hour timeslot! During these
    half-hour sessions, we can typically walk through how to solve 2-5 problems
    (depending on their difficulty). I can also assign or recommend you extra
    assignments to strengthen your coding and algo skills, as needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Fast and helpful email responses</strong> -  Outside of your
    private session time, you can also get "asynchronous" help by asking me
    questions via email. This enables you to have learning road-blocks solved
    any weekday, even if there is no private lesson.</p>
    <p><strong>Customized plans</strong> - The plans below are priced based on
    how many private lessons you are purchasing. Choose a plan below, or
    schedule a call so we create plan for your custom educational goals or
    time-frames!</p>

    <div class="bt-well">
        <h3 style="color: #404">Month-to-Month</h3>
        <p>$99 per session  | 4 sessions per month | $396 every month</p>
        <p>My basic plan is priced month-to-month with no further commitment, for
        ultimate flexibility.  Sign-up, choose a timeslot, and get learning!</p>

        <hr />
        <h3 style="color: #404">6 Month Plan</h3>
        <p>$83 per session  | 4 sessions per month | $1992 for 6 months</p>
        <p>I‚Äôve found many students working through my video-based coding academy
        use 6 months to both complete their customized program and get valuable
        training to jump-start their job-search. Similar to the month-to-month
        plan, but with a large discount for paying ahead. </p>

        <hr />
        <h3 style="color: #404">3 Month Intensive Plan</h3>
        <p>$68 per session | 12 sessions per month, $2448 for 3 months</p>
        <p>The Intensive Bootcamp tutoring plan provides 3 sessions a week for
        accelerated learning. I‚Äôve found students are capable of completing the
        program in 3 months with this intensive structure; however, as with all
        plans, this too can be customized.</p>

    <h2>DETAILS</h2>

    <h3>COACHING | Hack the ‚ÄúWhiteboard Problem‚Äù</h3>

    <p>I can provide 1:1 coaching on solving the notoriously difficult
    algorithm problems covered in the so-called ‚ÄúFAANG/MAMAA‚Äù ‚Äúwhiteboard‚Äù
    coding challenges. Having ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù, I now help students
    prepare for Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Technical Product Manager, and other
    sought-after roles at tech companies.</p>


    <h3>VIDEO PROGRAM INCLUDED | Learn ‚ÄúFull Stack‚Äù</h3>
    <p>If you are looking for a ‚Äúcoding bootcamp‚Äù-type program that‚Äôs more
    affordable, you‚Äôre in luck. Having lead dozens of full stack coding classes
    in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco, I have learned the importance of
    teaching to all skill levels. To that end, I have recorded an extensive
    video program, free to all my tutoring students: A full stack ‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù
    for anyone interested!</p>
