    <h2>TUTORING 1:1 PRIVATE LESSONS</h2>
    <h3>Now accepting new students</h3>

    <p>Are you looking for an extra boost in CS? Does Big O feel more like a Big
    Ol’ pile of confusion? Is Linux is going in one ear, and out to /dev/null? Or,
    having conquered the basics, are you looking for the next real challenge in
    your tech career?</p>

    <p>I can help! I’ve guided 100s of students before– let me help you!    My
    students range from coding newbies struggling with “weed-out” classes, to
    industry veterans needing an emergency “brushing up” on algos before the big
    interview.</p>

    <h3>COACHING | Hack the “Whiteboard Problem”</h3>

    <p>I can provide 1:1 coaching on solving the notoriously difficult
    algorithm problems covered in the so-called “FAANG/MAMAA” “whiteboard”
    coding challenges.  Having “been there, done that”, I now help students
    prepare for Frontend, Backend, DevOps, TPM, and others.</p>

    <h3>VIDEO PROGRAM INCLUDED | Learn “Full Stack”</h3>
    <p>If you are looking for a “coding bootcamp”-type program that’s more
    affordable, you’re in luck. Having lead dozens of full stack coding classes
    in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco, I have learned the importance of
    teaching to all skill levels. To that end, I have recorded an extensive
    video program, free to all my tutoring students: A full stack “bootcamp”
    for anyone interested!</p>
