    Oh, so you are looking at the source code?

    This site is written in my own declarative web component framework
    Modulo JS. I kept it simple so it's actually running in "dev" mode. This
    means you can even "build" it in your browser, if you want to! Really, try
    bringing up Dev Tools (Ctrl Shift J on some browsers) and look for the
    Modulo COMMANDS menu, then click "build" (possibly twice, if on Firefox).
    Boom, it just installed dependencies and built!

    Anyway, feel free to look at the rest of the source code to see how the
    "magic" happens ("look ma, no node_modules!")

    <h2>TUTORING 1:1 PRIVATE LESSONS</h2>
    <h3>Now accepting new students</h3>

    <p>Are you looking for an extra boost in CS? Does Big O feel more like a Big
    Ol’ pile of confusion? Is Linux is going in one ear, and out to /dev/null? Or,
    having conquered the basics, are you looking for the next real challenge in
    your tech career?</p>

    <p>I can help! I’ve guided 100s of students before– let me help you!    My
    students range from coding newbies struggling with “weed-out” classes, to
    industry veterans needing an emergency “brushing up” on algos before the big
    interview.</p>

    <h3>COACHING | Hack the “Whiteboard Problem”</h3>

    <p>I can provide 1:1 coaching on solving the notoriously difficult
    algorithm problems covered in the so-called “FAANG/MAMAA” “whiteboard”
    coding challenges.  Having “been there, done that”, I now help students
    prepare for Frontend, Backend, DevOps, TPM, and others.</p>

    <h3>VIDEO PROGRAM INCLUDED | Learn “Full Stack”</h3>
    <p>If you are looking for a “coding bootcamp”-type program that’s more
    affordable, you’re in luck. Having lead dozens of full stack coding classes
    in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco, I have learned the importance of
    teaching to all skill levels. To that end, I have recorded an extensive
    video program, free to all my tutoring students: A full stack “bootcamp”
    for anyone interested!</p>

        <p>Languages and Frameworks: Python, Django, Postgres SQL, Bash,
        JavaScript, React and more</p>
        <p>Extensive curriculum: 65+ hours of studio recorded “virtual workshop”
        videos, 200+ activities & mini-projects, 50+ cheat-sheets & study guides,
        20+ incremental, creative homework project guides (additionally, access to
        live recordings of my lectures in Oakland, in case you want that “live
        classroom hum”)</p>
        <p>A guidebook: Kickstart Career, a 94 page guide-book on every stage of
        the Silicon Valley / SF tech job hunt</p>

    <h1>TUTORING PLANS</h1>
    <p><strong>Private Zoom-Based Half-Hour Lessons</strong> - We can get
    through <em>A LOT</em> of stuff in a half-hour timeslot! During these
    half-hour sessions, we can typically walk through how to solve 2-5 problems
    (depending on their difficulty). I can also assign or recommend you extra
    assignments to strengthen your coding and algo skills, as needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Fast and helpful email responses</strong> -  Outside of your
    private session time, you can also get "asynchronous" help by asking me
    questions via email. This enables you to have learning road-blocks solved
    any weekday, even if there is no private lesson.</p>
    <p><strong>Customized plans</strong> - The plans below are priced based on
    how many private lessons you are purchasing. Choose a plan below, or
    schedule a call so we create plan for your custom educational goals or
    time-frames!</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 style="color: #404">Month-to-Month</h3>
    <p>$99 per session  | 4 sessions per month | $396 every month</p>
    <p>Our basic plan is priced month-to-month, for ultimate flexibility.
    Sign-up, choose a timeslot, and get learning!</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 style="color: #404">6 Month Plan</h3>
    <p>$83 per session  | 4 sessions per month | $1992 for 6 months</p>
    <p>Like the month-to-month plan, except a structure where you save by
    paying ahead. We’ve found many students working through our video-based
    coding academy use 6 months to both complete their customized program and
    get valuable training to jump-start their job-search.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 style="color: #404">3 Month Intensive Plan</h3>
    <p>$68 per session | 12 sessions per month, $2448 for 3 months</p>
    <p>Our Intensive Bootcamp tutoring plan provides 3 sessions a week for
    accelerated learning. We’ve found students are capable of completing the
    program in 3 months with this intensive structure; however, we are also
    flexible - if you are taking longer, you can renew and continue, or even
    switch to another plan while you get coaching during the job hunt!</p>
